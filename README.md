Instructions on how to use this can be found here: http://iosgods.com/topic/20580-the-new-auto-lipolipoarm64-with-ios-5-6-7-8-9-support/

This still works but isn't suggested to use anymore since LipoARM64 is no longer maintained. You can use https://github.com/iOSGods/Auto-Lipo-for-iOS-5-to-iOS-11-Binary-Only instead.
